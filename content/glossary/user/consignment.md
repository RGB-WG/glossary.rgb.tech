# Consignment

Data package exchanged between users (peers) when they are using RGB smart contracts (or participate some other
client-side validation protocol).

<aside>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The term was first introduced in 2020 by Maxim Orlovsky in RGB v0.2</p>
</aside>

In blockchain world, the data are stored in the public ledger (blockchain) and replicated by each peer. This leads
to the loss of privacy, informational centralization and poor scalability. RGB smart contracts use client-side 
validation, which keeps the data on the peers site and doesn't put them into a blockchain or any shared ledger.
The data are exchanged between peers on an ad-hoc basis, only when needed, in pure peer-to-peer way, which significantly
improves the privacy, scalability and decentralization. The package of the data exchanged by peers specific to some
particular RGB contract is called **consignment**.

<aside>
    <h2>Non-consignment packages which peers can exchange?</h2>
    <p>Consignments are not the only type of data packages which peers exchange in client-side validation protocols.
    There is another package type named <a href="disclosure">disclosure</a>, which is not a contract-specific. Unlike
    consignment, disclosures are used to provide the networks or third-parties with some information which otherwise
    would remain private.</p>
